My name is Gabriel Quan Littow and I´m a currently studying at Universidad del Valle de Guatemala. As first instance, I like security ( linux ), creating all sort of projects ( Python ), and programming arduinos ( C+ ). I´m looking forward to learn more and to develop more abilities in the not so far future.
